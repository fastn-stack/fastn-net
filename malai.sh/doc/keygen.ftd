-- p.doc-page: `malai keygen`: Generate identities

It is possible for some systems to not have a working keyring. In such cases,
you can use `malai keygen`.

-- ds.heading-large: `malai keygen`: Generate identities

-- ds.code: Using `malai keygen`
lang: bash

\$ malai keygen --file

Generated Public Key (ID52): vvffhikufe6rb648ee3cfmeh1m5hk7gq2pa8jqpb2l3svpcvsop0
Private key saved to `.malai.secret-key`.

-- ds.copy-regular:

You can use the `--file` option to save the private key to a file. If no value
is passed to the `--file` argument, it uses `.malai.secret-key` as the default
file name.

The public key is printed to the console.

If the `--file` arg is not supplied then the private key is also printed to
stdout.

Other `malai` commands like `malai http` or `malai tcp` will try to read from
the following sources in order:

-- ds.copy-regular:

- `KULFI_SECRET_KEY` environment variable if set.
- `.malai.secret-key` file in the current directory.
- system keyring.

-- ds.copy-regular:

So for example you can run `KULFI_SECRET_KEY="<secret>" malai http` and it'll
use the environment variable value as secret instead of relying on your system
keyring.
