This command is used to create a server that responds to requests received from
a [`http-proxy`](/http-proxy/).

The machine becomes ready to start taking requests from other machines running
`malai http-proxy`.

\$ malai http-proxy-remote --public

The `<id52>` is printed when you run the `malai http-proxy-remote` command.
